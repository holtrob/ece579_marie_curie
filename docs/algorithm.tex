	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State Let $M = 68$ be the number of landmarks recognized in an image (constrained by dlib landmark recognition algorithm)
		\State Let $D = 2$ be the dimensionality of a single landmark
		\State Let $L \in R^{D, M}$ represent the raw pixel valued landmarks
		\State Let $L^\prime_R$ be the reference landmarks to score against
		\State Let $X$ be the chromosome to score
		\State Actuate X on the face using the Maestro Controller
		\State Capture an image, $I_C$, of the face
		\State Get the bounding box $B$ of the face
		\State Detect the center of a rectangular bounding box, $B_C = [x, y]^T \in \mathbb{R}^2$ of the face
		\State Detect raw landmarks for cand. image $L_C = dlib\_predictor(I_C).landmarks$
		\State Calculate new "centered" landmarks $L^C_C = L_C - (B_C \otimes \mathbf{1}^T)$
		\State Calculate the horizontal scaling by $x_s = B_{Right} - B_{C, x}$
		\State Calculate the vertical scaling by $y_s = B_{Bottom} - B_{C, y}$
		\State Get normalized landmarks $L^\prime_C = L^C_C \oslash ([x_s, y_s]^T \otimes \mathbf{1}^T)$
		\State Calculate difference in corresponding landmarks between the reference image and the candidate image $L_D = L^\prime_C - L^\prime_R$
		\State \Return $\| L_D \|_F = \sqrt{tr(L^T_DL_D)}$ where $L^T_DL_D \in \mathbb{R}^{(M, M)}$ is the Gramian matrix of $L_D$ and the diagonal elements of $L^T_DL_D$ represent the euclidean distance error of each landmark.  This can also be expressed as the square root of the sum of the squared errors.
